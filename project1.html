                <h2>Challenge</h2>
                <p>The challenge was to redesign a digital library in 48 hours, where users can borrow and return books. 
                    By improving access to books and literature, it reflects TCLI Foundation’s goal towards effecting 
                    societal changes through literature, arts and culture.</p>

            <div class="brief">
                <h2>Solution</h2>
                <p>Our application provides users with a wide selection of literature with common word choices in order to 
                    be more accessible to a wider range of audiences. We focused on user engagement through gamification 
                    and engaging the users in a community, as well as user-friendliness through simple word choices and 
                    information buttons.</p>

                <p>Our explore page provided users with the typical recommendations section as well as a community board, further 
                    engaging the audience. In our search tool, we provide a typical filter but with elements from scholarly 
                    databases. This provides users with the ability to expand their knowledge in academic realms or casually.</p>

                <p>Our goal was to keep the user engaged and motivated while navigating through the app and create a welcoming 
                    community for newcomers. Learning is fun! And we wanted to make sure that idea was translated through the 
                    screen. A timer? A level status? We’ve got it covered! We included a points system to help users feel 
                    accomplished when they completed a task, whether that be reading for a couple of minutes, finishing a book, 
                    or posting something in the discussion tab. </p>
