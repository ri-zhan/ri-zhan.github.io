        <h4>What's the problem</h4>
        <p>As current university students, we noticed that our peers and colleagues encountered various stressors during the school year, ranging from academics to extenuating circumstances. As a result, they often adopt unhealthy coping mechanisms such as suppressing their  emotions and isolating themselves.</p>
    </div>
    <div class="col-6 col-wrapper no-mb">
        <h4>We concluded that...</h4>
        <h2>Individuals struggle with documenting and pinpointing a pattern in  their emotions, often caused by a lack of safe space, time, or  motivation. The lack of self-reflection affects individuals’ dispositions and perpetuates emotional imbalance.</h2>
    </div>

<section>
    <h2 class="col-6 no-mb">We interviewed 8 young adults who were either in school or in a fast-paced, stressful field.</h2>
    <div class="col-6 col-wrapper">
        <h4>What did we find?</h4>
        <ul>
            <li>50% possess a lack of self-reflection routine and do not have a convenient coping mechanism at hand which leads to a vicious cycle of having poor mental health.</li>
            <li>50% experience anxiety and fear when voicing their struggle mainly  due to fear of judgement and a sense of uncomfortable vulnerability.</li>
            <li>Some interviewees said that they do not journal or self-reflect  consistently due to various reasons, but stated that they would like to do these things consistently or on a regular basis as they see the benefit in doing so.</li>
            <li>20% struggle with documenting and pinpointing a pattern in their emotions, often caused by a lack of safe space, time, or motivation.</li>
        </ul>
        <br>
        <p>As mental health is a sensitive topic, we also  interviewed a psychologist, who provided us with expertise on the topic  that guided our design decisions.</p>
        <ul>
            <li>Individuals may fixate on negative thoughts during an emotion-heavy process, especially self-reflection.</li>
            <li>Encourage mindfulness and provide positive reinforcement.</li>

                <h4>User flow</h4>
                <p>We established an overarching user flow that showed the various paths a user could go through in such a product.</p>

            <div class="col-wrapper">
                <h4>Task flows</h4>
                <p>Due to the time constraint set by this semester-long project, we only focus on two task flows within the larger user flow. First task flow being creating a new entry, second task flow being adding in afterthoughts.</p>

        <h4>Does it work?</h4>
        <p>I conducted 2 usability tests, with one of the original interviewees in-person and someone who was unfamiliar with the  project premise via online. These testing sessions were moderated. In  addition to the regular usability testing process, I also conducted A-B testing for specific features to gain clarity. See this <a href="https://drive.google.com/file/d/13ke7bmoil2OgmGRmBuViHh4fJRZjIzvY/view?usp=sharing">Usability Testing Report</a> for a detailed rundown. These tests benefitted the group immensely as we were able to further clean up our designs and justify certain design choices.</p>

        <h4>Quick & easy check-in</h4>
        <p>We provide users with an efficient way of doing a quick check-in and  the option to write a full entry. If users choose to write, here:after has a prompt generator which guides the user through the  process Users can hide and unhide entries, providing autonomy/control to what they want to see in this emotionally heavy process. Every entry can be edited within 24 hours of the initial entry, after which users have to create an afterthought.</p>

                <h4>Got more thoughts?</h4>
                <p>The afterthoughts feature addresses self-reflection, which is one of  the two main objectives of this app. After 24 hours of the initial entry, users add afterthoughts instead of editing the original entry. The process is very similar to adding the initial entry, but a bigger focus on reflecting, through recognizing/pinpointing emotions and  processing thoughts from the previous entry. Afterthoughts allow users  to confide in themselves in addition to whatever support they may or may not have outside of this app.</p>
            </div>
            <div class="col-wrapper">
                <h4>Find the date!</h4>
                <p>One of the reasons many users didn’t journal was because they couldn’t observe their progress from one day to another, which led to  them feeling like they weren’t making progress. Therefore, we added a  Calendar (and preemptively/hypothetically a statistics section) that  showed emotions from one day to another.</p>

            <h4>Next steps</h4>
            <p>Since the goal of this application is to allow users to be more aware of their emotions, an important aspect of the app would be expanding on tailored mental health resources, such as meditation and breathing  exercises, to journal and exercise with. The app will have more  mindfulness content and resources to facilitate users with this process.</p>
