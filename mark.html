                <h4>Hold on, how did we get here?</h4>
                <p>The project was presented to the team as an improvement project that was low-effort, low-stakes, and low-change that didn’t require new user research or a design overhaul. However, very soon after familiarizing myself with the product, I realized that Mark was largely non-functional.</p>
            </div>
            <img class="padded-bg col-10" src="images/mark/mark-old.png" alt="">
            <div class="col-6 col-wrapper">
                <h4>What's wrong</h4>
                <p>Visually, Mark was not the most pleasing: the lack of visual hierarchy  made it hard to extract relevant information for both authors and  learners, the layout of individual parts did not follow a natural  compositional flow, and the product did not follow a consistent design  system. 
                    <br/>Beyond aesthetics, the user experience  was hindered both in terms of design and in terms of bugs—unclear usage  and capabilities of Mark, a broken point-calculation system, long  waiting times for generated feedback, etc. 
                    <br/>Furthermore, the product was not on par  with existing competitor products. The stakeholders also wanted this  Mark improvement project to be completed on a quick timeline.</p>
            </div>
            <div class="col-6 col-wrapper">
                <h4>Thus,</h4>
                <p>The team formulated a plan with this new information: while I  conducted user research and upgraded the user interface, the development team would fix the existing bugs and apply YADS (the new design system) to  reusable components.
                    <br/>The user interviews for Mark were split into two divs. The first part was about what an AI-powered marking assistant would look like, and the second part asked for users’ feedback on the  existing product.</p>

                    <h4>Optimization</h4>
                    <p>Authors want Mark to make the assignment creation and marking process more efficient, perhaps by generating a template for an assignment based off of existing content or by providing ideas on the direction of an assignment.</p>

                <div class="col-wrapper">
                    <h4>Autonomy</h4>
                    <p>Authors want to be able to control what Mark can and cannot do for learners. For example, what the feedback will be, how elaborate Mark’s feedback for learners should be, and the whether or not the correct answer is displayed.</p>

                    <h4>Accuracy</h4>

For example, how an assignment is being  graded, how questions are being displayed, how they are being marked,  and more.

                    <p>Learners said that they found it hard to distinguish what they should be looking at when they first entered the assignment, which requires  the learner to conduct mental work before they enter an assignment that  may be timed or graded.</p>

                    <p>Mark did not have features that learners would want to see in a  basic assignment-taking product, such as flagging questions, the ability to view feedback after questions are submitted rather than immediately, and a functioning countdown timer.</p>

                <h4>Clarity hits</h4>
                <p>For authors, efficiency is key, and clarify definitely contributes to a seamless workflow. Providing authors with minor additions that  clarify the purpose of their input really enhances the overall  experience. Through doing this, we ensure the highest quality content is delivered to learners. For learners, their assignment and instructions  are now clearer since the author is able to create more accurate  information tailored for learners.</p>

                    <h4>Engaging experience</h4>
                    <p>By utilizing a more engaging and friendly language that asked the  authors and learners to complete their tasks at each step, Mark was able to achieve a higher satisfaction and engagement rate. The previously  dull instructions became an interactive process that felt more like  talking to an assistant for all users.</p>
