                            <p>Authors who create educational content often lack time to develop an assignment from scratch and do not have time to grade or  assess students' progress. 
                                Meanwhile, students typically want to receive feedback on their assignments and progress, but are unable to reach instructors who primarily create online educational resources. 
                                <b>How do we optimizes the content-creation process for educators, while integrating author feedback for students who are looking to learn and improve?</b>

                    <h3>User research</h3>

                    <div class="column-5-3">

                        <div class="column-5">
                            <p>
                                The project was presented to the team as an improvement project that was low-effort, low-stakes, and low-change that didn’t require new user research or a design overhaul. However, very soon after familiarizing myself with the product, I realized that Mark was pretty much non-functional.
                                <br/><br/>
                                Visually, Mark was not the most pleasing: the lack of visual hierarchy made it hard to extract relevant information for both authors and learners, the layout of individual parts did not follow a natural compositional flow, and the product did not follow a consistent design system.
                                <br/><br/>
                                Beyond aesthetics, the user experience was hindered both in terms of design and in terms of bugs—unclear usage and capabilities of Mark, broken point-calculation system, long waiting times for generated feedback, etc.
                                <br/><br/>
                                Furthermore, the product was not on par with existing competitor products. The stakeholders also wanted this Mark improvement project to be completed on a quick timeline.
                                <br/><br/>
                                Thus, the team formulated a plan with this new information: while I conducted user research and upgraded the user interface, the development team would fix the existing bugs and apply the new design system to reusable components.
                                <br/><br/>
                                The user interviews regarding Mark were split into two sections. The first part was about what an AI-powered marking assistant would look like, and the second part asked for users’ feedback on the existing product.

                                <li>Clear expectations: Learners want to know specific assignment details and whether or not they can expect to see it. For example, how an assignment is being graded, how questions are being displayed, how they are being marked, and more. If an author chooses not to display certain information, learners want to know that it was specified as such.</li>
                                <li>Relevant feedback: If feedback were provided, learners want to know what type of feedback they can expect. For instance, if the feedback will contain relevant course content, individual scores for each question, the correct answer(s), etcetera.</li>

                                <li>Cognitive overload: Learners said that they found it hard to distinguish what they should be looking at when they first entered the assignment, which requires the learner to conduct mental work before they enter an assignment that may be timed or graded.</li>
                                <li>Visual inconsistency: The product did not have consistent font sizes or great accessibility, making it hard for learners to find information or to focus on the assignment.</li>
                                <li>Limited functionality: Mark did not have features that learners would want to see in a basic assignment-taking product, such as flagging questions, the ability to view feedback after questions are submitted rather than immediately, and a countdown warning.</li>
