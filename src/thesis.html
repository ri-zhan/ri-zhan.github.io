        <h4>Preface</h4>
        <p>I am a child of immigrants and the first of the family to attend post-secondary. My peers are mostly local individuals who are not the first to attend post-secondary. My specific circumstances have cause some level of dissonance between my identity and who I thought I should be. This project invites you to take a look into what home has become for me.</p>
