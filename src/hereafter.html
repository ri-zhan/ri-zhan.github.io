The process is very similar to adding the initial entry, but a bigger focus on reflecting, through recognizing/pinpointing emotions and processing thoughts from the previous entry. Afterthoughts allow users to confide in themselves in addition to whatever support they may or may not have outside of this app.</p>

                        <p>One of the reasons many users didn’t journal was because they couldn’t observe their progress from one day to another, which led to them feeling like they weren’t making progress. Therefore, we added a Calendar (and preemptively/hypothetically a statistics section) that showed emotions from one day to another.</p>

                        <p>Since the goal of this application is to allow users to be more aware of their emotions, an important aspect of the app would be expanding on tailored mental health resources, such as meditation and breathing exercises, to journal and exercise with. The app will have more mindfulness content and resources to facilitate users with this process. </p>
