                    <h3>Individuals struggle with documenting and pinpointing a pattern in their emotions, often caused by a lack of safe space, time, or motivation. The lack of self-reflection affects individuals’ dispositions and perpetuates emotional imbalance.</h3>

                <p class="col-2r">As current university students, we noticed that our peers and colleagues encountered various stressors during the school year, ranging from academics to extenuating circumstances. As a result, they often adopt unhealthy coping mechanisms such as suppressing their emotions and isolating themselves.</p>

                        <p class="col-2l">50% possess a lack of self-reflection routine and do not have a convenient coping mechanism at hand which leads to a vicious cycle of having poor mental health.</p>
                        <p class="col-2ml">50% experience anxiety and fear when voicing their struggle mainly due to fear of judgement and a sense of uncomfortable vulnerability.</p>
                        <p class="col-2mr">Some interviewees said that they do not journal or self-reflect consistently due to various reasons, but stated that they would like to do these things consistently or on a regular basis as they see the benefit in doing so.</p>
