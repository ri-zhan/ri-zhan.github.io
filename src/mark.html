        <h4>Hold on, how did we get here?</h4>
        <p>The project was presented to the team as an improvement project that was low-effort, low-stakes, and low-change that didn’t require new user research or a design overhaul. However, very soon after familiarizing myself with the product, I realized that Mark was largely non-functional.</p>
    </div>
    <img class="padded-bg col-10" src="/images/mark/mark-old.png" alt="">
    <div class="col-6 col-wrapper">
        <h4>What's wrong</h4>
        <p>Visually, Mark was not the most pleasing: the lack of visual hierarchy  made it hard to extract relevant information for both authors and  learners, the layout of individual parts did not follow a natural  compositional flow, and the product did not follow a consistent design  system. 
            <br/>Beyond aesthetics, the user experience  was hindered both in terms of design and in terms of bugs—unclear usage  and capabilities of Mark, a broken point-calculation system, long  waiting times for generated feedback, etc. 
            <br/>Furthermore, the product was not on par  with existing competitor products. The stakeholders also wanted this  Mark improvement project to be completed on a quick timeline.</p>
    </div>
    <div class="col-6 col-wrapper">
        <h4>Thus,</h4>
        <p>The team formulated a plan with this new information: while I  conducted user research and upgraded the user interface, the development team would fix the existing bugs and apply YADS (the new design system) to  reusable components.
            <br/>The user interviews for Mark were split into two divs. The first part was about what an AI-powered marking assistant would look like, and the second part asked for users’ feedback on the  existing product.</p>

    <h2 class="col-6">What do authors need and want when creating an assignment with assistance from an AI-powered marking assistant?</h2>

    <div class="col-3">
        <div class="col-wrapper">
            <h4>Optimization</h4>
            <p>Authors want Mark to make the assignment creation and marking process more efficient, perhaps by generating a template for an assignment based off of existing content or by providing ideas on the direction of an assignment.</p>
        </div>
        <div class="col-wrapper">
            <h4>Autonomy</h4>
            <p>Authors want to be able to control what Mark can and cannot do for learners. For example, what the feedback will be, how elaborate Mark’s feedback for learners should be, and the whether or not the correct answer is displayed.</p>
        </div>
        <div class="col-wrapper">
            <h4>Accuracy</h4>
            <p>Authors want to know that Mark is giving accurate feedback through testing and through specifying certain parameters within Mark.</p>

            <h2>How does current Mark live up to authors’ expectations? (Warning: it doesn’t)</h2>
            <p>In other words, what are authors’ current pain points when creating an assignment with Mark?</p>
        </div>
    </div>
    <div class="col-3">
        <div class="col-wrapper">
            <h4>Lack of clarity</h4>
            <p>The instructions for authors to create assignments with Mark were unclear. Authors commonly wondered what instructions were for Mark and  which were for learners.</p>
        </div>
        <div class="col-wrapper">
            <h4>Inadequate visual indicators</h4>
            <p>There were virtually no visual indicators that signalled to authors  that they missed a field or had filled something out incorrectly. Could  you point out why you couldn’t save your work using the screenshot here?</p>
        </div>
        <div class="col-wrapper">
            <h4>Poor quality</h4>
            <p>The product had discreet but breaking bugs, which were a result of a lack of quality assurance testing.</p>

        <h2>Authors seek to speed up their workflow and want to be confident  that their AI-powered assistant is providing their best for learners.</h2>

    <h2 class="col-6">Hey learners! What does a good assignment-taking experience look like?</h2>
    <img class="padded-bg col-7" src="/images/mark/mark-learner-needs.png" alt="">
    <div class="col-3">
        <div class="col-wrapper">
            <h4>Clear expectations</h4>
            <p>Learners want to know specific assignment details and whether or not  they can expect to see it. For example, how an assignment is being  graded, how questions are being displayed, how they are being marked,  and more. If an author chooses not to display certain information,  learners want to know that it was specified as such.</p>
        </div>
        <div class="col-wrapper">
            <h4>Good visual hierarchy</h4>
            <p>Usually assignments are filled with relevant information scattered  everywhere, so learners want to be able to quickly view for the most  important information on the page.</p>
        </div>
        <div class="col-wrapper">
            <h4>Relevant feedback</h4>
            <p> If feedback were provided, learners want to know what type of  feedback they can expect. For instance, if the feedback will contain  relevant course content, individual scores for each question, the  correct answer(s), etcetera.</p>

    <div class="col-3">
        <div class="col-wrapper">
            <h4>Cognitive overload</h4>
            <p>Learners said that they found it hard to distinguish what they should be looking at when they first entered the assignment, which requires  the learner to conduct mental work before they enter an assignment that  may be timed or graded.</p>
        </div>
        <div class="col-wrapper">
            <h4>Visual inconsistency</h4>
            <p>The product did not have consistent font sizes or great  accessibility, making it hard for learners to find information or to  focus on the assignment.</p>
        </div>
        <div class="col-wrapper">
            <h4>Limited functionality</h4>
            <p>Mark did not have features that learners would want to see in a  basic assignment-taking product, such as flagging questions, the ability to view feedback after questions are submitted rather than immediately, and a functioning countdown timer.</p>

    <h1 class="col-6">The revamped Mark experience</h1>
    <div class="col-6 col-wrapper">
        <h4>Clarity hits</h4>
        <p>For authors, efficiency is key, and clarify definitely contributes to a seamless workflow. Providing authors with minor additions that  clarify the purpose of their input really enhances the overall  experience. Through doing this, we ensure the highest quality content is delivered to learners. For learners, their assignment and instructions  are now clearer since the author is able to create more accurate  information tailored for learners.</p>

        <div class="col-3 col-wrapper">
            <h4>Engaging experience</h4>
            <p>By utilizing a more engaging and friendly language that asked the  authors and learners to complete their tasks at each step, Mark was able to achieve a higher satisfaction and engagement rate. The previously  dull instructions became an interactive process that felt more like  talking to an assistant for all users.</p>
        </div>
    </div>
    <div class="col-10 align-x">
        <div class="col-3 col-wrapper">
            <h4>Seamless optimization</h4>
            <p>Mark has a lot of capabilities now, including helping authors  generate assignment content, and we ensured that authors can decide  whether or not they want the help of Mark. We want authors to know that  they are in control and Mark is simply an assistant.</p>

            <h4>Scalable and adaptable future</h4>
            <p>On the other end of the screen, the product was now easier to scale.  The layout and content was group in a more methodological way instead of being restricted to one section that contained all the information. In combination with YADS, Mark has a bright future.</p>
