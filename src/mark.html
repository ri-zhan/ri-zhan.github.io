                <h2 class="col-6l">How do we optimize the content-creation process and enable autonomy for authors, while eliminating excess cognitive load and allow easy information extraction for learners?</h2>
            </div>

            <div class="wrapper-content">
                <h3 class="col-5l">Hold on, how did we get here?</h2>
                <p class="col-5r">The project was presented to the team as an improvement project that was low-effort, low-stakes, and low-change that didn’t require new user research or a design overhaul. However, very soon after familiarizing myself with the product, I realized that Mark was largely non-functional.</p>
            </div>

            <div class="wrapper-content">
                <h3 class="col-5l">What's wrong?</h2>

                    <div class="wrapper-inner">
                        <h4>Lots of things.</h4>
                        <p>Visually, Mark was not the most pleasing: the lack of visual hierarchy made it hard to extract relevant information for both authors and learners, the layout of individual parts did not follow a natural compositional flow, and the product did not follow a consistent design system.
                            <br/>Beyond aesthetics, the user experience was hindered both in terms of design and in terms of bugs—unclear usage and capabilities of Mark, a broken point-calculation system, long waiting times for generated feedback, etc.
                            <br/>Furthermore, the product was not on par with existing competitor products. The stakeholders also wanted this Mark improvement project to be completed on a quick timeline.</p>

                    <div class="wrapper-inner">
                        <h4>The Plan</h4>
                        <p>Thus, the team formulated a plan with this new information: while I conducted user research and upgraded the user interface, the development team would fix the existing bugs and apply the new design system to reusable components.
                            <br/>
                            The user interviews for Mark were split into two divs. The first part was about what an AI-powered marking assistant would look like, and the second part asked for users’ feedback on the existing product.</p>
