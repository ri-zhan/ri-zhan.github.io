                    <h2>My philosophy: The Ri-pple Effect?</h2>
                    <p style="display: inline-block;">My design philosophy can be understood as “the ripple effect”: Design, 
                        in any form, once introduced, causes disturbance to a system. Design 
                        is not just a practice, but also a method of intervention within systems 
                        and a system itself. Hence, designers (like me) must take responsibility 
                        for the work they put out and help realize the consequences of design decisions. 
                        <br>
                        <br>
                        We often get so ingrained in the work we do that we fail to see the wider 
                        effect we have upon a system. For instance, the 
                        <a href="https://ssir.org/articles/entry/the_curb_cut_effect" target="_blank">
                        curb-cut effect</a>, though specifically applicable to universal design, 
                        illustrates the effects of a single design decision: an act of activism echoed 
                        through the world’s infrastructure as all curbs now have an extra 
                        <a href="https://ssir.org/articles/entry/the_curb_cut_effect#:~:text=Berkeley%20advocate%2C%20%E2%80%9Cthe-,slab%20of%20concrete,-heard%20%E2%80%99round%20the" target="_blank">
                        "slab of concrete"</a>. 
                        <br>
                        <br>
                        On the flip side, there are unintentional ramifications of design decisions. 
                        My mother is a restaurant manager who works with multiple food delivery apps. 
                        When I visited her last year, she told me about an unnamed app’s new design 
                        update—and she was absolutely furious. Having the experience that she has and 
                        being the age that she is, she did not need the constant repeated ringing 
                        notification that wouldn’t shut up unless you spent more than five seconds 
                        addressing it (something that shouldn’t take more than half a second), 
                        especially not in combination with the colored text that she cannot see under 
                        the yellow-ish restaurant lighting. She kept saying, “You office workers need 
                        to get out into the world, you know nothing when you are just sitting at the 
                        desk” (imagine this in a Chinese-mother-who-really-just-wants-you-to-succeed 
                        tone). I couldn’t agree more. Designers broke the system and I got an earful 
                        about it.
                        <br>
                        <br>
                        Maybe all this is to say that I believe we need to properly do our design job. Empathize,
                        iterate, communicate, over and over and over again until we truly understand 
                        the context, conceptualize the needs, and make sure my mother doesn’t tell 
                        me about terrible design in the car ride home again.
                        <br>
                        <br>
                        (Also my name is Ri and Ri is in "ripple" and I hope my attempt to be witty made you smile).

                    <p class="col-6l center" style="display: inline-block;">Check out my <a href="resume.html"">resumé</a> to see some of my work experiences, including IBM, York University, and Matrix.

                        <br>
                        Other than my experiences, my skills extend far beyond my (lack of) humour. 
                        Figma is my best friend, and together we make a great team. 
                        I’m also advanced in Adobe CC applications, from InDesign and Illustrator 
                        (designer needs) to Photoshop and Lightroom (photographer needs) 
                        and Premiere Pro and After Effects (videographer (enthusiast) needs). 
                        I also dabble in a bit of coding, having coded at some of my previous 
                        jobs and coding this website, using HTML, CSS (&amp; SASS), Javascript 
                        (&amp; jQuery), Python, and Ruby on Rails for all sorts of things.
                        <br>
                        <br>
                        In addition to my love for so many tools, I also LOVE shortcuts. 
                        That’s to say, I’m an extremely efficient designer (and computer user). 
                        I always speed up the design process as best I can in order to keep up 
                        with my fast thoughts, enabling me to streamline workflows which is 
                        particularly helpful when the team reaches a high-stress season.

                        I’ve discovered my interest in travelling recently so I’ve been skedaddling around North America. In 2024, I went to New York (February), Montreal (July), Chicago (October), and of course Toronto (for the final year of school) and Vancouver (for home).
                        <br><br>
                        I’m also currently the Co-President of the <a href="https://www.linkedin.com/company/yorkudsa" target="_blank">Design Students’ Association</a>, where I lead a team of 20 executives to unite the 250+ students of the Design at York programs. It’s been an honour to work with the team for the past years in different roles and I’m extremely excited for all our upcoming events.
