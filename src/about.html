    <h2 class="col-6">What can I do for you?</h2>
    <p class="col-6" style="display: inline-block;">Check out my <a href="https://drive.google.com/file/d/1Cfn1SDgth__OWwvJ3uAtb3d2765z3qRC/view?usp=drive_link" target="_blank"">resumé</a> to see some of my work experiences, including IBM, York University, and Matrix.
        <br>
        Other than my experiences, my skills extend far beyond my (lack of) humour. 
        Figma is my best friend, and together we make a great team. 
        I’m also advanced in Adobe CC applications, from InDesign and Illustrator 
        (designer needs) to Photoshop and Lightroom (photographer needs) 
        and Premiere Pro and After Effects (videographer (enthusiast) needs). 
        I also dabble in a bit of coding, having coded at some of my previous 
        jobs and coding this website, using HTML, CSS (&amp; SASS), Javascript 
        (&amp; jQuery), Python, and Ruby on Rails for all sorts of things.
        <br>
        In addition to my love for so many tools, I also LOVE shortcuts. 
        That’s to say, I’m an extremely efficient designer (and computer user). 
        I always speed up the design process as best I can in order to keep up 
        with my fast thoughts, enabling me to streamline workflows which is 
        particularly helpful when the team reaches a high-stress season.

    <h2 class="col-6">Shenanigans: What am I up to these days?</h2>
    <p class="col-6" style="display: inline-block;">This portfolio is always in progress, as design is always growing as a practice, as an industry, and as a passion. 
        <br><br>
        I’ve discovered my interest in travelling recently so I’ve been skedaddling around North America. In 2024, I went to New York (February), Montreal (July), Chicago (October), and of course Toronto (for the final year of school) and Vancouver (for home).
        <br><br>
        I’m also currently the Co-President of the <a href="https://www.linkedin.com/company/yorkudsa" target="_blank">Design Students’ Association</a>, where I lead a team of 20 executives to unite the 250+ students of the Design at York programs. It’s been an honour to work with the team for the past years in different roles and I’m extremely excited for all our upcoming events.
