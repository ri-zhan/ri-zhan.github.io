            <h2 class="col-6l">Hold on, how did we get here?</h2>
            <p class="col-2r">The project was presented to the team as an improvement project that was low-effort, low-stakes, and low-change that didn’t require new user research or a design overhaul. However, very soon after familiarizing myself with the product, I realized that Mark was largely non-functional.</p>

                    <p class="caption">Problem?</p>
                    <p>Visually, Mark was not the most pleasing: the lack of visual hierarchy made it hard to extract relevant information for both authors and learners, the layout of individual parts did not follow a natural compositional flow, and the product did not follow a consistent design system.
                        <br/>Beyond aesthetics, the user experience was hindered both in terms of design and in terms of bugs—unclear usage and capabilities of Mark, a broken point-calculation system, long waiting times for generated feedback, etc.
                        <br/>Furthermore, the product was not on par with existing competitor products. The stakeholders also wanted this Mark improvement project to be completed on a quick timeline.</p>

                <div class="wrapper-inner">
                    <p>Thus, the team formulated a plan with this new information: while I conducted user research and upgraded the user interface, the development team would fix the existing bugs and apply the new design system to reusable components.
                        <br/>The user interviews for Mark were split into two sections. The first part was about what an AI-powered marking assistant would look like, and the second part asked for users’ feedback on the existing product.</p>
